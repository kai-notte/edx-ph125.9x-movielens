edX | Data Science: Capstone - MovieLens Project
The following documentation describes my solution for the edX Course "PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone" by HarvardX.

The target of this project is to build a recommendation system based on the MovieLens dataset. This dataset includes various user ratings for more than 10,000 movies from the last years. The task is to predict user ratings with machine learning algorhythm which we have learned in previous courses. 

To receive most credit points, the course instruction requires a final root mean square error of lower or equal 0.8649.
